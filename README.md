Guess digits of PI - available in two versions (Console and WPF app).

# How does it work
The app first loads a text file that contains the first 1000 digits of PI. Then, the user enters digits, one by one.

Each correct digit rewards 1 point; each incorrect digit counts as a fail, and the game ends after 3 fails. However, upon entering an incorrect digit, the correct one is placed automatically.

Try to get as many points as possible!

# Available projects
